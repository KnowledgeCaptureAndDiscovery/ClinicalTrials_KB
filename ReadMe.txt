Future Work:

1. Initial example of KG: manually convert the 2 clinical trials criteria into KG
2. Improve Similarity Matching Methods on: Inclusion, Exclusion criteria, and drugs
3. Similarity Matching on Additional Statistics, Treatment Plan and Outcome (data from papers)
4. Assign weights on each criteria to get final similarity between 2 clinical trials
5. Given a clinical trial, how to convert it fully and automatically into KG
6. Compare with other clinical trials in the KG
